The idea of creative destruction is the process by which adaptation and change occur. It’s similar to firms and industries because it’s already a familiar concept in economics that can be displayed by the company Nokia. NOKIA used to manufacture rubber boots. However, the firm adapted to new opportunities because it got into the telecommunications industry. However, it has not adapted to smartphones which is why it has been overtaken by Samsung. This illustrates how if firms do not adapt, then they will be replaced with new firms that are better adapted to today’s environment – through the creative destruction process. Essentially, it’s describing how innovation allows the “new” to replace the “old.”

Coevolution represents the idea that everything and everyone in a complex adaptive system of the economy is evolving to the environment it will face. This concept is significant because it shows that complex adaptive systems are not tending towards an equilibrium of some sort – the economy is just adapting and evolving continuously. It’s also important because it reinforces the idea that “we have to experiment, learn, and adapt alongside all the other parts with which we are co-evolving.”
